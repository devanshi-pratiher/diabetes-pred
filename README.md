# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
Diabetes Prediction
This dataset is derived from Kaggle which is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It is important to note that all patients in the dataset are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

In this project, we will be solving the problem of how different features or indicators that humans have can predict whether the individual has diabetes.
The features in the dataset are:
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)


Analyzing these features to find and evaluate patterns using multple Machine Learning models will help determine the prediction score to check whether the individual has diabetes or not. The final feature is Outcome, which is the predictor feature in this classification dataset and provides the indicator of diabetes.

We will be using Logistic Regression, KNN and Decision Tree Classifier.
